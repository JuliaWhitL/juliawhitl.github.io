I'm a data scientist at Meta where I study generative AI tools. I currently live in Seattle, WA with my husband, daughter and Billie, our neurotic Beagle rescue.

A little bit about how I got here. In 2024 I completed my MS in biostatistics at Vanderbilt University, where I also worked as a statistician on the ACTIV-6 trial. My research focused on the relative merits of different variance estimators. I spent some years before that working in cancer research as a data manager (2019-2021) and trials coordinator (2017-2019), studying colorectal and neuroendocrine cancers. I graduated from Imperial College London with a degree in epidemiology (2014), and was also an editor and bartender in a past life.
